        <h2> First step: </h2>
        <p> Chinchillas should be offered a bath once a day, for about 20 minutes. If the bath is left longer than this, it may become soiled and your chinchilla wont want to use it. Change the dust at least once a week. Also check their eyes because a build-up of dust can cause eye problems.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Second step: </h2>
        <p> It's recommended that you don't pick your chinchilla up unless necessary - a frightened chinchilla that is being too strongly held will shed handfuls of fur. Instead you can train your chinchilla to jump into a carrier to allow you to move them around for things like a health check or a vet visit.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> Third step: </h2>
        <p> Give your chinchillas time out of their cage to run around. Practice encouraging them to climb on you during this time, but don't put them back in their cage as soon as they climb on you.</p>
